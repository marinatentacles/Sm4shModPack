6. Once you are back to the Home Menu again, load up your version of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.

## Notes

* It is perfectly normal for your game to take a bit longer to load. If it hangs for a minute or two at the splash screen when loading the game, don't freak out. Just sit tight and let it do it's thing.
* CSS Portraits take longer to load than usual. This is due to several characters having over 16 costumes.
* You may need to adjust your song selection settings in My Music so that the new music plays as often (or as little) as you'd like.
